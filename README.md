# Closed_Loop_NCUC_Dataset-Load_RES_Feature_System
This is the dataset for the paper entitled "Feature-Driven Economic Improvement for Network-Constrained Unit Commitment: A Closed-Loop Predict-and-Optimize Framework"

This dataset is saved as .xlsx and includes:

* Day-ahead prediction and actual realization of Belgian load, solar power farms, wind power farms. (From 2018/01/01 to 2020/12/31) 
* Configurations of modified IEEE RTS 24-bus system.
* Configurations of 5655-bus system. 
* Well-collected feature vectors.

To understand our modification on IEEE RTS 24-bus system, please check the following map. [Map.pdf](https://github.com/asxadf/Closed_Loop_NCUC_Dataset-Load_RES_Feature_System/files/7314204/Map.pdf)
