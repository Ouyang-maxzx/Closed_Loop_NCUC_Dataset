# Closed_Loop_NCUC_Dataset-Load_RES_Feature_System
This is the dataset for the paper entitled "Feature-Driven Economic Improvement for Network-Constrained Unit Commitment: A Closed-Loop Predict-and-Optimize Framework"

The data is collected from Belgian ISO named Elia. https://www.elia.be/en/grid-data

This dataset is saved as .xlsx and includes:

* Day-ahead prediction and actual realization of Belgian load. (From 2018/01/01 to 2020/12/31) [Load.xlsx](https://github.com/asxadf/Closed_Loop_NCUC_Dataset-Load_RES_Feature_System/files/7314318/Load.xlsx)
* Day-ahead prediction and actual realization of 13 solar power farms in Belgium. (From 2018/01/01 to 2020/12/31) [Solar_power_farm.xlsx](https://github.com/asxadf/Closed_Loop_NCUC_Dataset-Load_RES_Feature_System/files/7314319/Solar_power_farm.xlsx)
* Day-ahead prediction and actual realization of 7 wind power farms in Belgium. (From 2018/01/01 to 2020/12/31) [Wind_power_farm.xlsx](https://github.com/asxadf/Closed_Loop_NCUC_Dataset-Load_RES_Feature_System/files/7314320/Wind_power_farm.xlsx)
* Configurations of modified IEEE RTS 24-bus system. [System_IEEE_24_bus.xlsx](https://github.com/asxadf/Closed_Loop_NCUC_Dataset-Load_RES_Feature_System/files/7314314/System_IEEE_24_bus.xlsx)
* Configurations of 5655-bus system. [System_ISO_5655_bus.xlsx](https://github.com/asxadf/Closed_Loop_NCUC_Dataset-Load_RES_Feature_System/files/7314356/System_ISO_5655_bus.xlsx)
* Well-collected feature vectors. [Feature.xlsx](https://github.com/asxadf/Closed_Loop_NCUC_Dataset-Load_RES_Feature_System/files/7314316/Feature.xlsx)

Note that the load-RES data is collected every 15 minutes, so we add the subhour label to distinguish them.

To show our modification on IEEE RTS 24-bus system, we plot a map. Just check it out! [Map.pdf](https://github.com/asxadf/Closed_Loop_NCUC_Dataset-Load_RES_Feature_System/files/7314204/Map.pdf)
